My First Data Engineering Journey 🚀

I'm excited to share my first Web Scraping project built with Python!

I created a script that scrapes book data from Books to Scrape
 and organizes it into a clean, analysis-ready Excel file.

Key Achievements

Scraped book name, price (£), rating (1 to 5), and image URL for each book

Saved the data in a structured Excel file ready for analysis

Cleaned and formatted the dataset for easier usability

Tools & Skills Used

Python with:

Requests – for fetching website data

BeautifulSoup – for HTML parsing

Pandas – for cleaning and exporting data

Next Steps

Expand the script to handle dynamic websites using Selenium

Experiment with scraping e-commerce, news, and real-estate websites

Build larger automation and data-cleaning projects to sharpen my data engineering skills

This project marks the start of my journey in data automation and data engineering, and I’m looking forward to tackling bigger and more complex projects soon!
